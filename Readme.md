# Algorithms in the parallel environment
his repository consists of several programs written in C/C++ that demonstrate learned optimization techniques and parallel computation techniques on multicore processors and graphics cards. 
Projects were part of the [PCG](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/PCG/.en), [AVS](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/259559/.en), and [PRL](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/259440/.en) courses.
1. Odd-even merge sort and preorder traversal of graph using MPI.
2. Nbody simulation with CUDA and OPENACC.
3. Mandelbrot set and marching cubes in OpenMP.
